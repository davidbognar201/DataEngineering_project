# Data Engineering personal project

This repository is in the very early stages of development.

## Goal and the problem to solve

My goal is to get a deeper understanding of ETL processes and data orchestration. During this project, I'm planning to fetch data from a public API, store it in a database after doing the necessary transformation/validation and create a dashboard to visualize the data. To achieve this goal I'm going to use Docker, Apache Airflow, Python and MongoDB.
